        <h2>Summary Of "Born A Crime"</h2>
    <p>The first two chapters of “Born a Crime” talk about Trevor Noah’s journey.
        The racial injustices in South Africa. He talks about the 
        Immorality 1927,a South African law that criminalized sexual relationships betw-
        een whites and southAfricans.These explains racial tensionsand the impact of apartheid on individuals and families.
        Noah's mum ran away from home to live in Johannesburg. She had to hide because she could
        not trust anyone and it was illegal for Black people to live in the city.Noah was “a mixed 
        child” and had to hide most of the time not to be seen and this affected his relation
        ship with his father.
        Noah's journey shows racial injustice and struggle for equality in South Africa.
        Patricia was a Christian who took her family to churches every Sunday
        Before apartheid they had tribes which had conflicts,the Zulu and the Xhosa. Xhosa
        women were seen as prostitutes.Patricia was criticized
        by a driver for traveling with children at night.
         <h2>How It Relates To My County</h2>
        In Machakos County,favourism is a main challenge
        as the people of upper class are highly favored.These contribute to classes
        of rich and poor.Single mothers are judged for being unmarried and seen immoral.Women are religious. 
        Apart from going to church on Sundays, women have fellowships,women’s day,meet weekly
        They are the backbone of Christianity in their households.Insecurity is an issue as many people do not have
        a source of income and steal.The matatu’s drivers fight over customers and abuse each other.
